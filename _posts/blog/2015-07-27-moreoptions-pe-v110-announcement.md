I'm happy to announce that AgameR MoreOptions PE v1.1.0 is coming soon!
Some of the new features it will have:
* Commands (starting with dots)
* Upgraded morphing with skin viewer and trails (player customizer)
* More options (tapspammer msg editor, gamespeed customizer, hide main button)
* More hacks
* Bug fixes

A little preview for the commands can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Pr3qfZPAc48).
