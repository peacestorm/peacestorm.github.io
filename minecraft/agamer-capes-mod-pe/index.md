##Known bugs and issues

• Capes rotate to the left or to the right sometimes, when they're not supposed to.<br>
• The cape menu doesn't work on some devices (if this happens for you, put the cape's url manually inside of /games/com.mojang/minecraftpe/mods/capesmodpe.txt).<br>
• No cape animation yet (this is not really a bug).

##Credits

• Thanks to rainbowyoshismbx for some parts of the code.<br>
• Thanks to DAW330073 for the saving code.<br>
• Thanks to RedstoneGunMade for some parts of the MCPE GUI API.<br>
• The cape model and the rest of the mod is made by peacestorm (myself).
